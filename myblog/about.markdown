This is my personal blog built using Jekyll. 
so far the best website builder I ever used.

Nothing much to brag about myself. 
For about 15 years, my day job is - Technical Consultant for Oracle HCM Cloud. well obviouly Oracle cloud platform is configurable, less code platform - lead me to try different coding endevours using AI/ML/Web3. I am still testing the waters of AI & ML technologies, Web3.
Expect to see a lot of content about my musings on AI/ML/Web3 and ofcourse Oracle SQL for web/data analytics, REST API automations in R & Python; integrating external systems like github, svn to Oracle Cloud platforms etc...

My humble trial to get out of Oracle world, and join more fun & dev oriented technologies such as AI/ML/Web3.
